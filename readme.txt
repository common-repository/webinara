= Webinara Premium =

We offer a Premium License key that will enable premium features in the plugin. For getting a premium license key, the admin needs to click on "Upgrading to PRO" button from "Upgrade to premium" tab on the "Settings" page. For generating a premium license key, the plugin will use Webinara API services to communicate with https://www.webinara.com website. The plugin will ask for an email ID and some other information (First name, Last name and other necessary informations) to create an account on https://www.webinara.com server and get a license key. After successful payment, the admin should copy the license key from  https://www.webinara.com account and paste it to the License key field in the plugin settings page. This license key will be valid for one year and the admin should renew it manually after each time period. Each license key will be valid for one website, it will work for one website at a time. If the admin wants a new one, the admin should create it on the https://www.webinara.com website account.

The admin can access this  https://www.webinara.com website account directly anytime and access premium features such as post webinars, subscribe with upcoming webinar email, etc. After activating the premium license key, user's profile information will sync with the https://www.webinara.com website and plugin, so the admin can change it anytime easily via either the plugin or https://www.webinara.com account.

The admin can downgrade this license anytime by clicking on "Downgrade" button. When the admin downgrades the license, all premium features will be disabled in the plugin. The admin can enable it anytime again via adding the license key from https://www.webinara.com website account.
